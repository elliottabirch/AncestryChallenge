It is responsive to large, medium, and small screens. 
The form is validating, and is ready to recieve the logic to add a new user to a database

Issues

  * No stock photos were given, so I improvised 
  * There were no mockups for the smaller screens, as compared to the full..*size, so I improvised. 
  * None of the links to other pages work, but they are ready to recieve the logic to redirect.
